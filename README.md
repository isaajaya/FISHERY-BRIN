This code controls the water temperature using Dallas Temperature sensors and relays for heating and cooling. The ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi to set the time via NTP and sends temperature data via ESP-NOW. The temperature and hysteresis settings are stored in EEPROM and can be changed via serial input.
